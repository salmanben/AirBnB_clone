# AirBnB Clone - Command Interpreter

## Description

This project is the first part of the AirBnB clone, focusing on building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. It serves as the foundation for developing the entire AirBnB web application, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with AirBnB objects and perform various operations, such as creating, updating, deleting, and listing objects. It is an essential tool for managing the different classes used in AirBnB, like User, State, City, Place, and more.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AirBnB_clone.git

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:
cd AirBnB_clone

3. Run the command interpreter:
./console.py


## Using the Command Interpreter

Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with it by typing commands and arguments. Here are some basic commands and their usage:

- **Create an object:**
create <classname>


- **Show an object:**
show <classname> <object_id>


- **Exit the interpreter:**
quit

For more detailed instructions and commands, you can use the `help` command within the interpreter.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

1. Creating a new User:
create User


2. Listing all City objects:
all City

**Note**: This README assumes that you have already set up the necessary environment and dependencies for running the AirBnB clone project.

Enjoy using the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter!
